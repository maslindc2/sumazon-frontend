# Sumazon (client side)
## What is this repository?
This is the client side for a quarter long project in my software architecture course at Seattle U.  This is a very basic eCommerce site using a 3-tier architecture.
### What's the stack?
This uses the MEVN stack.
- MongoDB is the database we are using for the third/data tier.
- Express and Node used for the second/server tier.
- Vue.js is what we are using for the first/client tier. 
	- Pinia is used for state management and used for authentication, image, and shopping cart temporary storage. 
### How do I check it out?
The frontend is hosted live [here](https://sumazon-frontend.vercel.app/). 
Or if you are feeling ambitious you can clone this respository and do the following.
1. Open the directory you cloned the repo to and run npm install.
2. Once installed, you can then run npm run dev, and open a browser to http://localhost:5173
